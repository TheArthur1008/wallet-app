Application for managing financial wealth "Wallet"

The wallet is designed according to the modern principle of Single Page Application, which allows the user to load only one page when browsing the address, and then draw the necessary elements of the page without reloading. For the security of user data, the application implements a transition through the so-called Private and Public routes, so that third-party users cannot access personal finances.

For new users, a registration page is provided, where we can fill out the form and use all the functionality of the application. In short, I developed a responsive page, according to the developed design, and implemented the protection of all fields from entering incomprehensible characters, sending them to the database for future use. There is also a link to the authorization page, if suddenly the user has a login and password. On this page, you can enter your details and access your personal wallet. The form for sending data is also protected by checks of the correctness of the entered data and will prompt the user if something is written incorrectly. The start page has a top bar with the logo and username, under the logo hides an intuitive link to the home page, and under the username and the logout icon - a link to the login page and logout of the current account. On the left, we see a link to Transactions and wallet statistics, the current account status and the current exchange rate. When we go to the Home tab, we see a table of all user transactions, each field of the table is interactive - you can sort the table by headers in a convenient way, by transaction - we dismiss the modal window for editing the operation. In the statistics element, a visual diagram of costs and profits for the entire period is drawn. It is also possible to select a period of time by months and years for which statistics should be drawn. Below is a table with statistics by categories of expenses or income.
